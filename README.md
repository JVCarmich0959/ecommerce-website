# React E-commerce Demo

This repository showcases a simple e-commerce storefront built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It demonstrates modular components, custom hooks, and sample product data that can be adapted to any brand.

## Features
- Responsive layout with hero carousel and product grid
- Shopping cart and wishlist powered by React context
- Category filtering and newsletter signâ€‘up section
- Ready to customize with your own products and styles
- Optional A.I. modules for product recommendations and chat assistance

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Visit <http://localhost:3000> to view the site.
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## A.I. Enhancements
This demo now outlines optional features powered by A.I. services. Example ideas include a
product recommendation engine that learns from user behavior and a chatbot that answers
common questions. These modules are decoupled from the core codebase so you can integrate
your preferred A.I. provider or extend them with your own models.

## Who is this for?
### Potential Clients
Use this project as a starting point for an online store. The codebase is organized for easy customization and can be extended to fit your business requirements.
